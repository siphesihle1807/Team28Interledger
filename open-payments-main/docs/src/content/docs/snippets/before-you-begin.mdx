import { LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

Before working with our code snippets, we recommend creating a wallet account on the <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>test wallet</LinkOut> that's part of the Interledger testnet.

The test wallet lets you create developer keys and wallet accounts, funded with play money, for making Interledger transactions via the Open Payments APIs.

## Create an account on the test wallet

1. Go to <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev">wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut>.
2. Click **Create an account** at the bottom right of the screen.
3. Enter your e-mail address, a password, confirm the password and click the arrowhead.
4. Go to your inbox and look for an e-mail sent by `tech@interledger.org` with the subject "[Test.Wallet] Verify your account" and click **Confirm my email address.** <br />
5. Click **Login to your account** at the email verification screen.
6. Log in with your credentials.
7. Complete the KYC steps, and liveness check. The only real information you need to share is your email address and phone number. All other information can be fictitious. If a photo is required, you can upload anything as long as it's not blank.

You're now ready to create a test wallet and add money to it!

## Create a wallet account

1. You can create a wallet account by clicking **New Account.**
2. Enter a name for the account, choose an asset code (the currency) from the drop-down menu and click **Create account.**
3. Click **View Account.**
4. Click **Add payment pointer.**
5. Enter a Payment Pointer name and a Public name and then click **Create.**
6. Click **Deposit**.
7. Enter an amount, then click **Deposit**.

Congratulations, you now have a funded test wallet!

## Obtain a public-private key pair and key ID

Before you can initialize an authenticated Open Payments client, you must obtain a public-private key pair and a key ID.

1. Sign in to <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut>, if not already signed in.
2. Select **Settings > Developer Keys**.
3. Expand the drop-down menu for your wallet account.
4. Click **Generate public & private key**. Your key ID and public key appear on the site. A private key file named `private.key` automatically downloads to your machine.

You can now use your keys and payment pointer to initialize an authenticated Open Payments client.
